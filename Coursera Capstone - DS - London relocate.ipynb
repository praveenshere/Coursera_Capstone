There comes a point in time where due to the change in circumstances - socio-economic, financial, cultural or due to any other factors like change in job, expanding family, one may decide to shift his / her home and relocate to another property. There are a number of factors that one may consider to choose where to shift. Some of the factors can be: easy access to public transport, low crime rate in the area, good schools or educational institutions, healthcare facilities, entertainment avenues, make-up of the population in the area, socio-economic indicators within the area amongst others.",

The project will try to utilise most of the relevant data science topics learned in the lead up to the certification to answer the question. The actual criteria for selection would be reviewed, weighted and finalised as part of the final submission, however some of the initial indicators which are to be considered would be:\n1. Access to public transport\n2. Access to essential amenities - schools, medical care\n3. Community safety - crime rate, incidents etc.,\n4. Housing indicators - like average house prices, repossessions etc.,\n5. Make up of the borough in terms of entertainment avenues, most visited places etc.,\n6. Make-up of the population in terms of age, socio-economic indicators etc.,\n7. Environment quality - pollution, green spaces etc.,       ",

[Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk \"Office for National Statistics\")\n3. Foursquare API location data - for specific borough level details\n\nData obtained from these sources are likely to be in mixed format - csv, Microsoft excel etc., and care should be taken to ensure that the most appropriate data is obtained from the data sources, validated, cleansed and loaded into appropriate data structures (like pandas data frames) for analysis, clustering and to obtain the solution to the problem statement.",
